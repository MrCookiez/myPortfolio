  "text": "I started to get involved with web development after graduating from Manpower Employment Organization as a Technical Support In Computer Systems at 2015, where I learned my first computer language HTML. After that I continued my studies in Institution of Vocational Training to become a certified web designer/developer in June 2016. At the same time I enrolled in different web design and web development courses at Udemy, SitePoint, CodeAcademy and also watching videos at various websites like TheNewBoston and Youtube of course. And now I am a freelancer web designer/developer and the same time student in Hellenic Open University in field of Computer Science."
